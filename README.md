# Motus Metrics

Motus Metrics is a research-oriented initiative focused on the development and study of geometric and metric approaches to motion analysis and related physiological data.

The aim of the initiative is to explore principled ways of describing structure, variability, and dynamics in complex movement and performance data, with a particular interest in applications within sport and human movement sciences.

## Current Project

**Human Movement Geometry (HMG)**  
A research project investigating geometric representations of human gait variability using non-Euclidean metric frameworks.

The project is accompanied by:
- a research article (preprint)
- an open-source reference implementation

## Ongoing and Future Directions

Beyond the current project, Motus Metrics also serves as a framework for exploratory work on novel metrics and representations in applied sport science contexts, including movement diagnostics, performance testing, and integrative analysis of biomechanical and physiological data.

Specific implementations and datasets are documented within individual repositories as they become available.
